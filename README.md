# LSTM-security-event-sequence-predict
Predict the security event sequence based on LSTM(Long short-term memory)-based model using Pytorch.
This goal of this project is to predict the next seven days of security event sequence based on LSTM-based model using Pytorch.
Most of the datasets are DDos attack.
